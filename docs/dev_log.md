## Development Log



### Dec,2019
#### Adapt com.rpl.spector
The [specter](https://github.com/redplanetlabs/specter/) enable the huge map `deal` possible for being updated in a elegant way. 
The `specter` is pretty much under estimated in the community. The refactoring requires a progressive work ahead while 
surely will lead to greater benifit in terms of managing complexity.

#### Building minimal example
Eventhough laying out the couple namespaces for difference components,but clojucture doesn't really has a workable examlple.
I'm try to build one and validate the cashflow with spreadsheet, hopefully it can be done before 2020.1.1
